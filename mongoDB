**mongod --version 
**Database is a physical container for collections
**In sql,data is stored in tables in format of files
**In mongoDB,the data is stored in form of key value pair and stored in documents
**We can get data from server through json
**A mongodb server has typically multiple databases
***MONGODB terms-
   fields
   document
   collection---group of documents
**ODM--->object document mapper --->MONGODB

**Features of MONGODB:-
  1.scheme-less
  2.document-oriented
  3.Indexing--->unique indentification given to documents and to fetch the data
  4.Scalability-->horizantal scalability with help of sharding(that distributes data in multiple servers)
  5.Replication--->when server is down and unable retrieve the data then we can get the data from another server
                copy the data from one server to another
  6.Aggregation-->allows to perform operations on grouped data and get single result
  7.High performance

**Disadvantages of mongodb
 1.It uses high memory
 2.not allowed to store more than 16mb data
 3.The nesting of data in BSON(both storage and network)is limited you are not allowed to nest data more than 100 levels
